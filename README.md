# PTZ-Protocol-Converter
Panasonic PTZ to PELCO-P protocol converter


This is a Free & Opensource project for everyone who love protocol undrestanding by me.

old panasonic speed dom camera use an old protocol for thier PTZ commands so you can not add them 
to modern CMS like Genetec , I write a protocol converter on Nodejs to change the panasonic PTZ protocol 
to PELCO-P protocl that known for Genetec software in realtime.

all you need to run this project is, install Nodejs & fill the config file the run it!
